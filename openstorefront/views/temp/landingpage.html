Areas of focus will include development of a Privilege Management strategy for the DoD and evaluation and integration of implementation techniques such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Risk Adaptive Access Control (RAdAC). The DoD&#39;s net-centric information sharing environment, and evolution towards increased interoperability with other federal agencies and coalition partners, requires applications and systems to evolve their current authentication, authorization, and access control paradigms to support both anticipated and unanticipated users.</span></div></blockquote><component-list click-callback="updateDetails" hide-more="true" class-list="min" title="idAM Components" data="data" cols="3" type="IDAM"></component-list><br>More content filled with interesting information, links, and other useful resources...<br><br><strong>More Components (with different filters or a different search result)</strong><br><component-list click-callback="updateDetails" hide-more="true" class-list="min" title="Visualization Components" data="data" cols="3" type="Visualization"></component-list>
